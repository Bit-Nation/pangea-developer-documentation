### Setup
In order to start developing you need the [pangea cli](https://github.com/Bit-Nation/pangea-cli) and the [DApp template](https://github.com/Bit-Nation/dapp-template/releases).
The pangea cli will help you with development and the DApp template is a common base developed by Bitnation to make DApp development easy. We advise new devs to use the DApp template.
You can install the pangea cli via npm and the DApp template should be downloaded from the release page.
